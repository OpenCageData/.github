We run a worldwide [geocoding API](https://opencagedata.com/api) and [geosearch](https://opencagedata.com/geosearch) service based on open data. 
Learn more [about us](https://opencagedata.com/about). 

We also organize [Geomob](https://thegeomob.com), a series of regular meetups for location based service creators, where we do our best to highlight geoinnovation. If you like geo stuff, you will probably enjoy [the Geomob podcast](https://thegeomob.com/podcast/).
